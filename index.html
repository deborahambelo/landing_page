      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        This project was inspired by the need to have a simple and effective
        tool for managing personal finances. Over the years, I've struggled with
        keeping track of my expenses and income. This inspired me to create an
        easy-to-use expense tracker that can help others manage their finances
        better. This project was developed as part of my portfolio for Holberton
        School.
